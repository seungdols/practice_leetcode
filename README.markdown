# Why trying to solve on the quiz of leetcode?

* Because of improving solving ability.
* Sometimes, it's fun.
* It isn't what I work in the company. 


## Goal 

* I try to a minimum of 2 problems per week.
* I effort to solve the problem of leetcode in many ways.
* Instead of spending so much time on a problem, you learn to solve the problem.
* I try to solve problems in various languages. The problem you solved should also be solved in another language.
